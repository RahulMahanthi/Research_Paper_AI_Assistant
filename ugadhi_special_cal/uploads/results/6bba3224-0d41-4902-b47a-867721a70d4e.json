RESEARCH FOCUS COMPARISON:\n\nPaper 1 focuses on the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for the detection and classification of plant diseases in maize and soybean crops. The core research question is to assess the accuracy and robustness of CNN models in identifying various diseases in these crops. The objectives include employing transfer learning techniques, optimizing hyperparameters, and using data augmentation strategies to enhance the model's performance. The domain of this research is agricultural technology and plant pathology.\n\nPaper 2, on the other hand, focuses on stock price movement prediction using deep learning techniques, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Support Vector Regression (SVR). The core research question is to compare the predictive accuracy of LSTM and SVR for stock price movement. The objectives include applying LSTM and SVR to various stock index data and evaluating their performance. The domain of this research is financial technology and time-series data analysis.\n\n2. METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH:\n\nIn terms of similarities, both papers utilize existing datasets and employ machine learning techniques to address their research questions. Paper 1 uses CNN models (AlexNet and ResNet-50) for image classification, while Paper 2 uses LSTM and SVR for time-series data prediction. Both studies also involve data preprocessing and hyperparameter optimization to enhance model performance.\n\nHowever, there are significant differences in their methodological approaches. Paper 1 concentrates on image analysis and transfer learning techniques, while Paper 2 focuses on time-series data prediction and comparing the performance of two distinct machine learning techniques.
