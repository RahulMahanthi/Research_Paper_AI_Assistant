RESEARCH FOCUS COMPARISON:\n\nPaper 1 focuses on the application of deep learning techniques, specifically LSTM and SVR, to predict stock price movement using various stock index data. The core research question would be to determine the effectiveness of deep learning methods in predicting stock prices compared to traditional approaches.\n\nPaper 2, on the other hand, presents a deep learning model based on a time series LSTM model to detect anomalous behaviors in the Chinese stock market. The main research objective is to improve anomaly detection in financial markets, particularly in the Chinese stock market.\n\nBoth papers share a common domain, financial markets, and utilize deep learning techniques. However, Paper 1 is more focused on stock price prediction, while Paper 2 is concerned with anomaly detection in stock prices.\n\n2. METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH:\n\nPaper 1 uses univariate and multivariate time series models, with the data split into training and testing sets according to the 'tradeDate'. The Conv1D-LSTM model is employed to derive features from datasets, especially time series data. The Conv1D layer slices the data into readable lengths for LSTM inputs. The paper uses a total of 7 hidden layers with an Adam optimizer, sigmoid activation function, and dropout of 0.2.\n\nUnfortunately, Paper 2 does not provide a detailed methodology in the document. However, it does mention using a univariate and multivariate time series models and a Conv1D-LSTM model. Due to the lack of information, a thorough comparison cannot be made.\n\n3. FINDINGS AND RESULTS:\n\nPaper 1's key finding is that LSTM provides better accuracy compared to SVR in predicting stock price movement using various stock index data. This result contributes to the field by demonstrating the potential of deep learning techniques in stock price prediction.\n\nPaper 2 successfully predicts the anomalous price behaviors of the '601318' stock in the range of 2019-02-13. The model improved MSE to 0.0171 on validation datasets and consistently generates MAE less than 4.0. This result contributes to the field by showcasing the effectiveness of the proposed deep learning model in detecting anomalies in stock prices.\n\n4. SCHOLARLY CONTRIBUTION:\n\nPaper 1 contributes to the field by providing a comparative analysis of deep learning techniques, LSTM and SVR, in predicting stock prices. The study offers insights into the advantages of LSTM over traditional methods in stock price prediction.\n\nPaper 2 contributes to the field by presenting a deep learning model specifically designed for anomaly detection in the Chinese stock market. The paper's findings can help financial markets and regulatory authorities in identifying and addressing anomalous behaviors in stock prices.\n\n5. SYNTHESIS:\n\nThese two papers, while sharing a common domain and utilizing deep learning techniques, focus on different aspects of financial markets. Paper 1 is concerned with stock price prediction, while Paper 2 addresses anomaly detection. Both studies contribute to the field by demonstrating the potential of deep learning methods in financial market applications. However, due to the lack of methodological detail in Paper 2, a thorough comparison cannot be made. Future research could explore the integration of stock price prediction and anomaly detection techniques to provide a more comprehensive approach to financial market analysis."}}
