RESEARCH FOCUS COMPARISON:\n\nPaper 1 focuses on the application of deep learning techniques, specifically LSTM and SVR, to predict stock price movement. The core research question would be to determine if deep learning methods can improve the accuracy of stock price prediction compared to traditional approaches. The main objective is to prove the superiority of LSTM over SVR in predicting stock price movement. The domain of this research is financial markets, with a specific focus on stock price prediction.\n\nPaper 2, on the other hand, presents a deep learning model based on a time series LSTM model to detect anomalous behaviors in the Chinese stock market. The primary research question is to assess if a deep learning model can effectively detect anomalous price behaviors in financial markets. The main objective is to improve the Mean Squared Error (MSE) in predicting time series stock price data and successfully predict anomalous price behaviors of specific stocks. The domain of this research is also financial markets, with a focus on anomaly detection in the Chinese stock market.\n\n2. METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH:\n\nBoth papers use deep learning techniques, specifically LSTM models, as part of their methodological approach. However, there are differences in the frameworks and techniques employed.\n\nPaper 1 utilizes both LSTM and SVR models to predict stock price movement. The researcher uses different stock index datasets, such as S&P 500, and compares the accuracy of the two models. The methodology summary does not provide detailed information on the preprocessing steps or the specific LSTM architecture used.\n\nPaper 2, in contrast, uses a univariate and multivariate time series model with a 1D convolution layer to slice the data into manageable lengths for LSTM inputs. The model is trained for 13 randomly selected stock tickers, and the open price and turnover volume are used as important features. The Conv1D-LSTM model is employed to derive features from the datasets, particularly in time series data.\n\n3. FINDINGS AND RESULTS:\n\nPaper 1's key finding is that LSTM provides better accuracy compared to SVR in predicting stock price movement. However, due to the lack of specific results in the document, a detailed comparison cannot be made.\n\nPaper 2 demonstrates that the model improved MSE to 0.0171 on validation datasets and successfully predicts the anomalous price behaviors of the '601318' stock in the range of 2019-02-13. The model can also predict unseen data from previous datasets and identify possible anomaly behavior of '601318' in the test period.\n\n4. SCHOLARLY CONTRIBUTION:\n\nPaper 1 contributes to the field by providing evidence that deep learning techniques, specifically LSTM, can improve the accuracy of stock price prediction compared to traditional approaches. However, the contribution is limited due to the lack of detailed results and specific information on the LSTM architecture used.\n\nPaper 2 significantly contributes to the field by presenting a deep learning model that can effectively detect anomalous price behaviors in financial markets. The paper also demonstrates the model's ability to improve MSE and successfully predict anomalous price behaviors of specific stocks. Additionally, the use of a univariate and multivariate time series model with a 1D convolution layer to slice the data into manageable lengths for LSTM inputs is a novel approach that could be of interest to other researchers in the field.\n\n5. SYNTHESIS:\n\nIn summary, both papers use deep learning techniques, specifically LSTM models, to address research questions related to financial markets. While Paper 1 focuses on predicting stock price movement, Paper 2 aims to detect anomalous price behaviors. The methodological approaches differ in the frameworks and techniques employed, with Paper 2 providing more detail on the preprocessing steps and LSTM architecture used. The findings and scholarly contributions of Paper 2 are more substantial due to the provision of specific results and the novel approach to time series data preprocessing.\n\nIn the broader research landscape, both papers contribute to the growing body of literature on the application of deep learning techniques in financial markets. However, Paper 2's focus on anomaly detection sets it apart and provides a unique perspective on the potential applications of deep learning in financial markets. Future research could build upon the methods and findings presented in both papers to further explore the potential of deep learning techniques in financial market analysis."}}
