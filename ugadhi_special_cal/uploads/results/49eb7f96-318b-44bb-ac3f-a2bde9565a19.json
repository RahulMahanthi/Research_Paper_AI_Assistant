RESEARCH FOCUS COMPARISON:\n\nPaper 1 focuses on the application of deep learning techniques, specifically LSTM and SVR, to predict stock price movement. The core research question would be to determine the effectiveness of these methods in improving the accuracy of stock price prediction compared to traditional approaches.\n\nPaper 2, on the other hand, presents a deep learning model based on a time series LSTM model to detect anomalous behaviors in the Chinese stock market. The main objective is to predict time series stock price data from historical data and identify anomalies in stock price behavior.\n\nBoth papers share a common domain, financial markets, and utilize deep learning techniques. However, Paper 1 is more focused on stock price prediction, while Paper 2 is centered on anomaly detection in stock price behavior.\n\n2. METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH:\n\nIn terms of methodological approach, both papers use deep learning techniques, specifically LSTM. However, Paper 1 also includes SVR in its methodology. Paper 2 employs a univariate and multivariate time series model with a 1D convolution layer to slice the data into manageable lengths for LSTM inputs. The model in Paper 2 is trained on 1000 days of data and validated on the last 219 days, while Paper 1 does not provide specific details about its training and validation process.\n\nAdditionally, Paper 2 uses Conv1D-LSTM architecture with a Non-Linear Activation Layer and Long Short Term Memory Networks (LSTM) to predict the time series of 'stockPrice', while Paper 1 does not specify the architecture used.\n\n3. FINDINGS AND RESULTS:\n\nPaper 1's results summary is not available, making a direct comparison challenging. However, Paper 2's key findings indicate that the proposed method improved MSE to 0.0171 on validation datasets and successfully predicts the anomalous price behaviors of the '601318' stock in the range of 2019-02-13. The model also consistently has a MAE of less than 4.0.\n\n4. SCHOLARLY CONTRIBUTION:\n\nPaper 1 contributes to the field by demonstrating the superiority of LSTM over SVR in stock price prediction. It provides evidence that deep learning techniques can improve the accuracy of stock price prediction compared to traditional approaches.\n\nPaper 2 contributes to the field by presenting a deep learning model for anomaly detection in the Chinese stock market. It provides a method for predicting time series stock price data from historical data and identifying anomalies in stock price behavior.\n\n5. SYNTHESIS:\n\nIn summary, both papers contribute to the field of financial markets and deep learning. While Paper 1 focuses on stock price prediction, Paper 2 focuses on anomaly detection. Both papers use LSTM in their methodology, with Paper 2 also employing a 1D convolution layer and a Non-Linear Activation Layer. Paper 1's results are not available for comparison, but Paper 2's findings indicate that its proposed method successfully predicts anomalous price behaviors in the Chinese stock market.\n\nIn the broader research landscape, both papers can be seen as complementary, with Paper 1 focusing on improving the accuracy of stock price prediction and Paper 2 focusing on detecting anomalies in stock price behavior. Further research can be done to explore the integration of these two approaches to enhance the overall understanding and prediction of stock market dynamics."}}
